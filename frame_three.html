<span class="imagehide">South America</span> is a continent[h] entirely in the Western Hemisphere[i] and mostly in the Southern Hemisphere, with a considerably smaller portion in the Northern Hemisphere. It can also be described as the southern subregion of the Americas.
<br><br>
South America is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean, on the north and east by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the south by the Drake Passage; North America and the Caribbean Sea lie to the northwest.
<br><br>
The continent includes twelve sovereign states: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela; two dependent territories: the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands;[j] and one internal territory: French Guiana.
<br><br>
The ABC islands of the Dutch Caribbean (north of Venezuela in the Leeward Antilles), Ascension Island (a part of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha), Bouvet Island (a dependency of Norway), Panama, and the Caribbean island country of Trinidad and Tobago may also be considered parts of South America. Aruba is geologically located on the South-American plate/continent,[8] but is often considered to be in the Caribbean.
<br><br>
South America has an area of 17,840,000 square kilometers (6,890,000 sq mi). Its population as of 2021 has been estimated at more than 434 million.[1][2] South America ranks fourth in area (after Asia, Africa, and North America) and fifth in population (after Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America). Brazil is by far the most populous South American country, with almost half of the continent's population, followed by Colombia, Argentina, Venezuela, and Peru. In recent decades, Brazil has also generated half of the continent's GDP and has become the continent's first regional power.
